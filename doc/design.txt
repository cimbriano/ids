	The main IDS takes two parameters to run.  A rule file conforming to the specified grammar and a jpcap trace files.
	The program begins by using the lexer and parser generated by JFLex and CUP to parse the rule file and instantiate
	objects defined in our def package.  These objects represent the various levels of abstraction of the rule file. The
	whole file is considered to be a ThreatDefinition and internally it has a host to which it applies.  Then it may have 
	zero or more rules which may be of type TCPProtocolRule or UDPProtocolRule.
	
	Once the ThreatDefinition all its subcomponents are instantiated, the IDS class starts a method from the jpcap library
	which reads each packet and calls an instance of PacketListener (IDSListener in our case).
	
	As each packet is read, each rule is asked to scan that packet to determine if it matches, or partially matches the contents
	of that rule.  In this way, it is not neccessary to read all the packets before determining if a subset of the packets in the trace
	match any given rule.  Further, each rule is equipped with means to send an alert to standard out as soon as a rule is fully matched.
	
	To see this more clearly, we output the colored string of each packet as it is read.  If an alert is triggered, it will 
	print to standard out before any other packets are examined.
